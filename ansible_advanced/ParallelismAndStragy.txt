The task involves dependencies, install mysql,start db, install flask, run webserver.

when multiple servers involed, for example 3 servers, Ansible runs 
it runs each task across all servers in parallel at the same time.
it waits for the task to finish on all servers before proceeding to the next task.

in this case, Ansible install dependencies accros all servers and waits for it to complete on all servers
befor proceeding to the next task.
-------------
linear strategy

If one server is slower than the others, it will slow down the entire playbook execution
this is called linear strategy and this is the default strategy.
-----
free strategy

- name: Deploy web application
  hosts: server1,server2,server3
  strategy: free

with the fre strategy when the playbook is run, each server runs all of its tasks independenly of the other server
and does not wait for the task to finish on the other servers.

------
Third option
Assume we have 5 servers but we would like ansible to execute three at a time
This is where batch processing helps us. This is not a separte strategy this is based on linear strategy,
but you can control the number of servers executed together or in a batch.
--------------
serial

- name: Deploy web application
  hosts: server1,server2,server3,server4,server5
  serial:3

you can specify how many servers you would like to process together. Here Ansible runs tasks on three servers first 
once that finishes all the tasks, ansible runs to proceed on the next batch (next 2 srvers).

 -----------
 Also,note that you can create your custom stragy by developing a strategy plugin yourself.
 --------------------
 fork = 5 (bydefault)
